<h2 align="center" style="color: #2e6c80;">Privacy policy</h2>
<p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software applications for mobile devices that are <br />
created by SeasApps.</p>
<p>This Policy covers our collection, use and disclosure of your information through the Applications, the Services and the Site. It does not cover any collection, use or disclosure by third parties through any applications, Web sites, products or services that we do not control or own, such as Dropbox, or any third party features or services made available via an Application, the Services or the Site. All trademarks, trade names, and logos of third parties featured on the Applications or the Site belong to their respective owners.</p>
<p>By using our Applications, the Services or the Site, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy.</p>
<h3><br />
  1. Sharing data</h3>
<p>We never share your data with anyone. To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including governments.</p>
<h3>2. Storing data</h3>
<p>Railwire Broadband Usage only stores the data it needs to function properly  for as long as you want Railwire Broadband Usage to function.</p>
<h3><br />
  Cloud Chats</h3>
<p>Railwire Broadband Usage is a cloud service. We store messages, photos, videos and documents from your&nbsp;<em>cloud chats</em>&nbsp;on our servers, so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime and use our instant server search to quickly access your messages from waaay back. All data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other DCs in different jurisdictions. This way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.</p>
<h3><br />
  Secret Chats</h3>
<p><em>Secret chats</em>&nbsp;use end-to-end encryption. This means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know. There is&nbsp;<strong>no way</strong>&nbsp;for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages. We do not store your secret chats on our servers. We also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats. For the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud you can only access those messages from the device they were sent&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>from</em>.</p>
<h3><br />
  Media in Secret Chats</h3>
<p>When you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server. This key and the file&rsquo;s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat&rsquo;s key &mdash; and sent to your recipient. He can then download and decipher the file. This means that the file is technically on one of Railwire Broadband Usage &rsquo;s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient. We don&rsquo;t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to. We periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.</p>
<h3>Contacts</h3>
<p>Railwire Broadband Usage uses phone numbers as unique identifiers, so that it is easy for you to switch from other messaging apps (SMS, WhatsApp, etc.) and retain your social graph. We ask your permission before syncing your contacts.</p>
<p>We store your contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Railwire Broadband Usage and to properly display names in notifications. We only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.</p>
<h3>Your e-mail address</h3>
<p>When you enable 2-step-verification for your account, you can opt to set up a password recovery email. This address will only be used to send you a password recovery code, if you forget it. That's right: no marketing or &ldquo;we miss you&rdquo; bullshit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Deleting data</h3>
<h3>Accounts</h3>
<p>If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the&nbsp;deactivation page. Deleting your account permanently removes all your&nbsp;<strong>messages</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>groups</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>contacts</strong>. This action must be confirmed via your Railwire Broadband Usage account and cannot be undone.</p>
<h3>Messages</h3>
<p>Everything you delete is deleted forever. Except for cats.<br />
  We never delete your funny cat pictures, we love them too much.</p>
<p>When you delete a message, you delete it from your message history. This means that a copy still stays on the server as part of your partner&lsquo;s message history. As soon as your partner deletes it too, it&rsquo;s gone forever. Railwire Broadband Usage's goal is not to bring profit and we value the disk space on our servers greatly.</p>
<p>In supergroups, deleted messages and original versions of edited messages are stored for 48 hours in order to be shown in the admins log.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Self-destructing messages</h3>
<p>Messages in Secret Chats can be ordered to&nbsp;self-destruct. As soon as such a message is&nbsp;read&nbsp;(2 checks appear), the countdown starts. When the time is out, both devices participating in a secret chat are instructed to delete the message (photo, video, etc.).</p>
<h3><br />
  Account self-destruction</h3>
<p>We value our disk space greatly. If you stop using Railwire Broadband Usage and do not login for at least 6 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Railwire Broadband Usage cloud. You can change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct in Settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We do not collect Personal Information, and we employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your Non-Personal Information from unauthorized access and use. Please be aware that, although we endeavor provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.</p>
